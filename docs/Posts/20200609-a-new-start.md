# Fresh Start

##### June 9th, 2020 By Alex Hu

After converting the Flex / ActionScript scripts to React + Redux at work for the last few years,
it is time to refresh the server side skill set as well. To document the journey, I decided to
work on an actual project as a test bed for different technologies.

There are quite a few things I would like to learn. The primary ones are

 - TypeScript
 - React with Hooks, without Redux
 - Node.js
 - GraphQL + Apollo

I also want to pick up these ones along the way:

 - MongoDB
 - Authentication
 - Docker
 - Cloud functions
 - Docker
 - Cloud deployment
 - AWS Free Tier / Google Cloud Platform Free Tier
