# CSS Frameworks

##### June 17th, 2020 By Alex Hu

Time to pick a [CSS Framworks](https://dzone.com/articles/11-best-css-frameworks-to-look-forward-in-2020) from

- Bootstrap / React Bootstrap
- Materialize CSS / Material-UI
- Semantic UI / Semantic-UI-React

### [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)

Bootstrap is a no brainer as it is ranked #1 in almost every list. So popular that I decided to use it at work.
This is the only reason that I didn't pick it for my personal project.

### [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

Android users will find this UI very comforting. In fact, I feel that it would make a page web look too much
like a phone screen especially with form input. I think I would try something new and may be switch back to
this one if there is a strong reason to do so.

### [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

Semantic-UI is another good one, with good documents and a long list of components to pick from. I am going to
try it out just because it is nice and shiny.
