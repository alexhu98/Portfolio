# Creating the User Interface

##### June 25th, 2020 By Alex Hu

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) will be used on the
client side. The content will be entered the form of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) using
[react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) as the UI component.

The Posts section will be built using the [Semantic UI's Card](https://react.semantic-ui.com/views/card/) component.

Each Post will have its own page hosting the Edit and Delete buttons. An Add button will be put in the Posts section.
