# Adding Timeline

##### July 08th, 2020 By Alex Hu

The [Material-UI Timeline](https://material-ui.com/components/timeline/) component is just the
user interface to provide a outline of development timeline. It puts a timeline in the center of
the page so there is a lot of white space on both side of it. I tried putting the sprint article
on the left and the post article on the right of the timeline, but all articles make a big
bad long scrolling page.

At the end, only the article title are placed at the timeline and the article is shown in a
[Dialog](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/) that
[slide up](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/#transitions) from the bottom.
