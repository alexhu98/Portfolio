# Adding Vertial Timeline

##### July 08th, 2020 By Alex Hu

The [Material-UI Timeline](https://material-ui.com/components/timeline/) component is just the
user interface to provide a outline of development progress. It puts a
[vertial timeline](https://uicookies.com/vertical-timeline/) in the center of the page
leaving a lot of white space on both side of it. I tried putting the article content
to fill those white spaces, but they make a big bad long scrolling page.

At the end, only the article title are placed at the timeline and the article is shown in a
[Dialog](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/) that
[slide up](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/#transitions) from the bottom.
