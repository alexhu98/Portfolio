# Choosing a Mobile App Framework
##### September 28th, 2020 By Alex Hu

There are quite a few choices for create a mobile app. As a learning project, it is important
to pick something new that I can give it a fair workout.

### Mobile App Frameworks

#### 1. [Android with Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/)

Since I already have experience with Android app with Kotlin using the ExoPlayer library, there is no
need to go down this path.

#### 2. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

React Native is probably the most logical choice, and you can pick from
[React Native CLI or Expo CLI](https://techstacker.com/react-native-expo-vs-react-native-cli-whats-the-difference/).
Given that I already have a few years on React, it would be good to pick something new to try out.

#### 3. [Flutter with Dart](https://flutter.dev/)

[Flutter vs Native Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEA9vw8t4Ho) explained the pros and cons quite well.

[Flutter Crash Course for Beginners 2020 - Build a Flutter App with Google's Flutter & Dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uinJvhNxI)
gave a good introduction of it. It reminded me of
[Adobe ActionScript and MXML](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html)
which I spent the last 2 years at work converting the end-of-life technology into React.js.

Another consideration is [Jet Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) which offer similar way
to build UI but with a much gradule migration path as you can add
[Compose to existing app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjQdFmiDgwk) quite easily.
In fact, I will build new fragments with Compose.

#### 4. [Ionic Framework with Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview)

I finally decided on using the Ionic Framework with Angular. Angular, being one of the big 3 UI frameworks,
is a good skill to pick up. Being able to build an iOS / Android / PWA / Desktop app using the Ionic Framework
is a big plus.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and
sophisticated single-page apps.

- [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) - Ionic Framework is is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building high quality,
cross-platform native and web app experiences. Move faster with a single codebase, running everywhere.

- [Ionic Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview) - Ionic Angular combines the core Ionic experience with the tooling
and APIs that are tailored to Angular Developers.
