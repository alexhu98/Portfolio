# Sprint 2 Deciding on a Framework

##### June 15th, 2020 By Alex Hu

As always, there are many paths one can take to archive a goal. So I am going to use this sprint to decide on a framework to move forward.

- ✔ Next.js + GraphQL + Knex
- ✔ Next.js + GraphQL + MongoDB
- ✔ Materialize
- ✔ Material-ui
- ✔ Semantic-ui
- ✔ react-bootstrap
