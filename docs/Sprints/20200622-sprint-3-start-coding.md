2. Create individual Post page with Edit and Delete buttons.

3. Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format to enter content

### Back End

1. Create a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
2. Use [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) server and client
3. Use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for database connection

### Database

Create a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database connection using the cloud [MongoDB Altas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
